## Overview

The Airbnb Bookings Analysis project investigates New York City listings to discover trends and insights that benefit **Airbnb**, **hosts**, and **travelers**. By exploring this dataset, we aim to enhance decision-making processes using data-driven insights.

## Problem Statement

Airbnb collects a vast amount of data, making it difficult to extract actionable insights. Our project analyzes **49,000+ listings in NYC** to answer key questions:
- What can we learn about hosts and neighborhoods?
- Which factors impact pricing, availability, and customer preferences?
- Why are certain hosts and neighborhoods more popular?
