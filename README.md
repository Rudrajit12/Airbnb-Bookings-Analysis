## Overview:
The Airbnb Bookings Analysis project dives into data on listings in New York City to uncover insights that can help Airbnb, hosts, and travelers. Using data analytics, this project aims to improve decision-making and enhance user experiences on the platform.

## Problem Statement:
Airbnb has a wealth of data, but itâ€™s often hard to extract actionable insights. This project focuses on analyzing 49,000 Airbnb listings in NYC to answer the following questions:
- What can we learn about different hosts and neighborhoods?
- How can this information help in making better decisions?
- Who are the most popular hosts, and why do some neighborhoods attract more visitors than others?

## Data Description:
**Data Source**: [Airbnb NYC Listings Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11DyDThliFDsjmkcfGr-QnA-q3C5A7M07/view?usp=sharing)

This dataset contains details about Airbnb listings in NYC, including host information, neighborhood, price, room type, availability, and booking history.

## Preliminary Questions:
Some key questions to guide our analysis include:
1. Who has the most places listed on Airbnb?
2. Which neighborhoods have the most listings?
3. What types of rooms are the most popular?
4. How does price vary by neighborhood and room type?

## Methodology:
1. **Define Objectives**: Identify key insights we aim to uncover.
2. **Data Collection**: Analyze the Airbnb dataset for NYC.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
4. **Exploration & Analysis**: Investigate the data for patterns, trends, and anomalies.
5. **Actionable Insights**: Provide recommendations to Airbnb, hosts, and travelers based on the findings.

## Analysis and Insights:
1. **Host Insights**: Hosts like Maya with multiple listings in the same neighborhood are highly popular due to competitive pricing and availability.

2. **Travelers**: Gain insights into how to find the best accommodations that suit their needs.
3. **Airbnb**: Can use these insights to improve its platform and cater better to users.

## Challenges & Limitations:

2. **Timeframe**: The data is from a specific time period and might not capture recent trends.
3. **Scope**: The analysis is focused on NYC; patterns may differ in other locations.

## Future Scope:
1. **Expanding to Other Cities**: Conduct similar analyses for other major cities.
2. **Advanced Prediction Models**: Use machine learning to forecast prices and availability.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze customer reviews to understand guest satisfaction.

## Conclusion:
