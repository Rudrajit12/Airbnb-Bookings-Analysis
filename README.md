## Overview

The Airbnb Bookings Analysis project investigates New York City listings to discover trends and insights that benefit **Airbnb**, **hosts**, and **travelers**. By exploring this dataset, we aim to enhance decision-making processes using data-driven insights.

## Problem Statement

Airbnb collects a vast amount of data, making it difficult to extract actionable insights. Our project analyzes **49,000+ listings in NYC** to answer key questions:
- What can we learn about hosts and neighborhoods?
- Which factors impact pricing, availability, and customer preferences?
- Why are certain hosts and neighborhoods more popular?

## Data Description

**[Download Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11DyDThliFDsjmkcfGr-QnA-q3C5A7M07/view?usp=sharing)**  
The dataset contains detailed information about Airbnb listings, including:
- **Host** and **listing information**
- **Neighborhood** data
- **Pricing** and **availability** details
- **Room types** and **booking history**

## Analysis Approach

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and correcting data inconsistencies.

### 2. Neighborhood Insights:
**Manhattan** and **Brooklyn** have the most listings, with higher prices due to demand. **Staten Island** offers cheaper, less frequented options.

## Future Scope

1. Expand the analysis to other major cities to compare trends.
2. Implement predictive models for **pricing** and **availability** based on seasonality.
3. Explore guest reviews for sentiment analysis and guest experience insights.
